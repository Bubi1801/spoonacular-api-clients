# SpoonacularAPI

The spoonacular Nutrition, Recipe, and Food API allows you to access over thousands of recipes, thousands of ingredients, 800,000 food products, over 100,000 menu items, and restaurants. Our food ontology and semantic recipe search engine makes it possible to search for recipes using natural language queries, such as \&quot;gluten free brownies without sugar\&quot; or \&quot;low fat vegan cupcakes.\&quot; You can automatically calculate the nutritional information for any recipe, analyze recipe costs, visualize ingredient lists, find recipes for what&#39;s in your fridge, find recipes based on special diets, nutritional requirements, or favorite ingredients, classify recipes into types and cuisines, convert ingredient amounts, or even compute an entire meal plan. With our powerful API, you can create many kinds of food and especially nutrition apps.  Special diets/dietary requirements currently available include: vegan, vegetarian, pescetarian, gluten free, grain free, dairy free, high protein, whole 30, low sodium, low carb, Paleo, ketogenic, FODMAP, and Primal.

## Building

To install the required dependencies and to build the elixir project, run:

```console
mix local.hex --force
mix do deps.get, compile
```

## Installation

If [available in Hex][], the package can be installed by adding `spoonacular` to
your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [{:spoonacular, "~> 1.1"}]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc][] and published on [HexDocs][]. Once published, the docs can be found at
[https://hexdocs.pm/spoonacular][docs].

## Configuration

You can override the URL of your server (e.g. if you have a separate development and production server in your
configuration files).

```elixir
config :spoonacular, base_url: "https://api.spoonacular.com"
```

Multiple clients for the same API with different URLs can be created passing different `base_url`s when calling
`SpoonacularAPI.Connection.new/1`:

```elixir
client = SpoonacularAPI.Connection.new(base_url: "https://api.spoonacular.com")
```
